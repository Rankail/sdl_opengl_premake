# SDL OpenGL

Simple test for setting up SDL & OpenGL with premake

## Setup

1. Install [premake](https://premake.github.io/) if don't already have it installed.
2. Generate project files for your IDE with the corresponding [premake action](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake).

> **NOTE**:\
> The supplied SDL-files are for MSVC.
> - Linux: Install the SDL-Package
> - MinGW: Get the Files from the latest [SDL-Release](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/)
> - otherwise you probably need to compile SDL yourself

> **NOTE**:\
> If you are using CLion you need to add [premake-clion](https://github.com/Rankail/premake-clion.git) to your premake-modules.
